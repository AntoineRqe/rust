# Financial Market Simulator

This project is a financial market simulator implemented in Rust. It consists of several crates that work together to simulate a financial market, including an order book, a matching engine, and a market data feed.

## Crates

- `order-book`: This crate implements the order book, which is responsible for maintaining the list of buy and sell orders in the market. It provides functionality for adding, removing, and matching orders. [Order Book](crates/order-book/README.md)
