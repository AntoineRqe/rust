**Analyzing the Domain**

I've broken down the domain `telemetry.grindr.mobi`, identifying "telemetry" as data collection and "grindr.mobi" as the mobile site of the dating app. Preliminary categorization places it in "Sites / Applications de rencontre" first. Further, "Domaine technique" is prioritized over "Services / Sites d'entreprises," due to telemetry's infrastructure role. Now researching with search queries to validate my assumptions.


**Refining Categorizations for Telemetry**

I've revised the categories and their order. My main conclusion is that "Sites / Applications de rencontre" remains most relevant. I now believe "Domaine technique" is the second-most fitting, given that the subdomain *explicitly* handles data collection. Then, "Publicité" is third due to the data usage for advertising. This new ordering better reflects the explicit role of "telemetry" and its impact. I've also considered alternative categories and why they might not apply as directly.
